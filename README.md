### Google

Google removed the extension from the Chrome Web Store following a claim:

> Globo Comunicação e Participações SA informs that the denounced extension is practicing and/or supporting the practice of illegal activities related to Globo's Copyright Law. This extension allows full and high resolution downloads of Globo content from the Globoplay streaming platform. The disclosure and sale of clandestine services puts the safety of consumers at risk and contributes to organized crime.

2. Open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable `Developer mode`
4. Drop the `hls-downloader.crx` file into the page

## Usage

1. Browse to a page that plays an HLS video and start playback.
2. Click the **HLS Downloader** icon. Detected playlists will appear in the
   **Sniffer** tab.
3. Choose **Select** next to the playlist you want to download.
4. Pick the desired video and audio streams from the playlist view.
5. Press **Download**. The extension fetches all segments and automatically
   merges them into a single MP4 using the bundled `ffmpeg.wasm`.
6. When processing completes, your browser will prompt you to save the merged
   file.

`ffmpeg` support is bundled with the extension so no external dependencies are
required.
