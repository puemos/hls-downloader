# Download from a direct link

If the extension doesn't automatically detect a playlist, you can add one manually.

1. Click the **HLS Downloader** icon and switch to the **Direct** tab.
2. Paste the HLS playlist URL (ending in `.m3u8`) into the input and press **Add**.
3. Select the playlist from the list and choose the video and audio streams you want.
4. Hit **Download** to fetch the segments and merge them into a single MP4.

This workflow mirrors a captured stream, letting you save videos even when sniffing fails.
