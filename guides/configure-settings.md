# Configure settings

Adjust how the extension downloads and saves streams.

1. Click the **HLS Downloader** icon and open the **Settings** tab.
2. Use **Concurrency** to control how many segments download in parallel. Higher values may speed up downloads on fast connections.
3. Change **Fetch Attempts** to set how many times the extension retries a failed segment.
4. Toggle **Save Dialog** to choose whether the browser asks where to save each file.

Tweaking these options lets you balance reliability and speed for your network and workflow.
