# Roadmap

Status key: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

Update a status by replacing the bracket token in the first column. Add notes/owners in-line to keep it lightweight.

| Status | Item | Scope/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ ] | Subtitle and CC capture | Parse SUBTITLES/CLOSED-CAPTIONS groups, show selectable subtitle tracks, export as .vtt/.srt or mux when present. |
| [ ] | Richer metadata and multi-audio UX | Surface LANGUAGE/NAME/CHANNELS, show encryption warnings, and allow selecting preferred audio when multiple exist. |
| [ ] | Direct/Sniffer UX polish | URL validation + errors, clipboard-friendly paste, history, dedupe/group by tab/domain, and icon badge improvements. |
| [ ] | Persisted and controllable queue | Persist playlists/jobs across restarts, add queued/pause/resume states, and apply backpressure in download epics. |
| [ ] | Size/ETA preview and naming controls | Keep EXTINF durations to estimate size/time; allow filename overrides/templates before downloading. |
| [ ] | Download view quality-of-life | Per-job logs/errors and throughput, restart/open-file actions, and auto-cleanup policy for old buckets. |
